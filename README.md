Setup Instructions (Local Development)

Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or higher)
MongoDB Atlas account
Git

Backend Setup
Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd task-tracker-app/backend


Install dependencies:
npm install

Create a .env file in backend/:
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/tasktracker?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key
PORT=3000

Start the backend:npm start

Backend runs on http://localhost:3000.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend:
cd ../frontend

Install dependencies:
npm install
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer axios jwt-decode moment react-router-dom

Initialize Tailwind:
npx tailwindcss init -p

Create a .env file in frontend/:
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

Start the frontend:
npm run dev
Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173.

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser to test.

Project Structure
backend/
models/: MongoDB schemas (User, Task, TimeLog)
routes/: API routes (auth, tasks, timelogs)
controllers/: Route handlers
middleware/: Authentication middleware

frontend/
src/pages/: Main pages (Login, Signup, Dashboard, Summary)
src/components/: Reusable components (TaskForm, TaskList, Timer)
src/ThemeContext.js: Dark/light mode context
src/index.css: Tailwind and global styles

.gitignore: Ignores node_modules, .env, and build artifacts

Deployment
Backend (Render):
Push backend/ to a GitHub repository.
Create a new Web Service on Render.
Set environment variables (MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, PORT) in Renderâ€™s dashboard.
Deploy and note the URL (e.g., https://your-backend.onrender.com).

Frontend (Vercel):
Push frontend/ to a GitHub repository.
Create a new project on Vercel and link the repository.
Add environment variable VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com in Vercel.
Deploy and note the URL (e.g., https://your-frontend.vercel.app).


Update README.md with live URLs.

Screenshots
(Optional: Add after deployment, e.g., via Imgur or GitHub assets)

Login/Signup: Gradient forms with smooth animations.
Dashboard: Responsive task grid with theme toggle.
Summary: Card-based metrics with hover effects.

Development Notes

Commits: Use meaningful commit messages (e.g., git commit -m "Add task CRUD functionality").
Debugging: Check browser console (F12) and backend logs for errors.
MongoDB: Ensure a free MongoDB Atlas cluster is set up and connected.
Vite Proxy: Configured in vite.config.js to forward /api requests to http://localhost:5000.

Bonus Features (Optional)

Charts: Add Chart.js for visualizing time spent (ask for implementation).
AI Suggestions: Integrate an AI API for auto-generating task titles/descriptions.
Reminders: Add notifications for pending tasks.

Troubleshooting

API Errors: Verify VITE_API_URL and backend URL match. Check Network tab (F12) for failed requests.
UI Issues: Ensure Tailwind and MUI dependencies are installed. Re-run npx tailwindcss init -p.
Auth Issues: Clear localStorage and re-login if token errors occur.
